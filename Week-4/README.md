# Portfolio App

## Overview

This portfolio app was developed as part of the **Advanced React Course** by Meta to showcase my skills and projects using React. The app includes various sections such as a header with external and internal links, a landing section with a bio, a project showcase, and a contact form.

## Portfolio Page Functionality

### Header

- External links to social media accounts are functional and take users to the respective platforms.
- Internal links smoothly scroll to their corresponding sections.

### Landing Section

- Avatar, name, and short bio are present.

### Project Section

- Projects are displayed in a 2x2 grid using card widgets.

### Contact Me Form

- The Contact Me form is implemented with the required business logic.

### Header Animation

- The header is hidden/shown based on scroll direction with a smooth transition animation.

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Consider optimizing images and assets for faster loading times.
- Add more details to the project cards, such as technologies used and project descriptions.
- Implement a light/dark mode toggle for better user experience.
- Test the app on different devices and browsers to ensure responsiveness.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/My-Portfolio.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd My-Portfolio`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the app: `npm start`
